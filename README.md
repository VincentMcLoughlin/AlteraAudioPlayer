# AlteraAudioPlayer

This audio player was created for a course at university. It reads .wav files and plays the audio found in them. It supports play, pause, fast forward, rewind, and song selection all using the altera audio core microcontroller. Most of the files from the project have not been included to reduce the risk of plagarism.
